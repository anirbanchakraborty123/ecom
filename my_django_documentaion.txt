================================HEY THIS IS MY DJANGO  DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS APP=========================

1. FIRST OF ALL OPEN POWERSHELL AND GOTO YOR PROJECT DIRECTORY
2. THEN CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT WITH THESE COMMANDS BELLOW:=
     A. PIP INSTALL VIRTUALENV
     B. VIRTUALENV YOUR_ENV_NAME  --> IT WILL CREATE A FILE WITH YOUR_ENV_NAME
     C. ./YOUR_ENV_NAME/Scripts/activate --> TO ACTIVATE THE ENVIRONENT
     D. NOW CHECK WITH PIP FREEZE
     E. IF FREEZE RETURNS NOTHING THEN ITS GOOD OTHERWISE ENV NOT INITIALIZED

     WE NEED TO WORK ON ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT EFFECT THE DEPENDENCIES OF OTHER PROJECTS

     EX: LIKE MY 1 PROJECT NEED DJANGO V.0  WHILE 2ND PROJECT NEED DJANGO V5 INSTALLED THEN
         WITH THIS REQUIREMENTS IF I WORK ON MY LOCALHOST THEN IT WILL CREATE DEPENDENCY ERROR
         SO TO AVOID THESE CONFLICTS WE USE VIRTUALENV . SPECIFIC DEPENDENCIES FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS 

3. ONCE ENV IS RUNNING THEN INSTALL DJANGO --> PIP INSTALL DJANGO
4. THEN CHECK PIP FREEZE IF DJANGO INSTALLED
5. THEN CREATE A DJANGO PROJECT WITH  ---> Django-admin startproject YOUR_project_NAME
6. THEN USING POWERSHELL GOTO YOUR_project_NAME --> CD YOUR_project_NAME
7. THEN RUNSERVER WITH ---> PYTHON MANAGE.PY RUNSERVER
8. IF SERVER RUNS THEN WE ARE GOOD TO GO
9. THEN INSTALL DJANGO CORS HEADERS :=
     A. pip install django-cors-headers
     B. IN THE PROJECT SETTINGS.PY IN INSTALLED_APPS ADD THIS ALSO = [
         'corsheaders',
         ]
     C.SAME AS (B) ADD THIS IN SETTINGS.PY
          MIDDLEWARE = [
            ...,
            'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
            'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
            ...,
             ]

     Django is a Python web framework that allows rapid web application development. 
     Apps developed in Django may need to interact with other applications hosted on 
     different domains (or even just different ports). For these requests to succeed, 
     you’ll need to use cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in your server.

     FOR EX. In order to illustrate how CORS works, let’s assume you have a web application 
     that lives in domain.com. But, to save user information, the app calls an API hosted in 
     another URL—for example, api.domain.com. So, when a request to save data is sent to api.domain.com, 
     the server evaluates the requests based on its headers and the request’s source.

10. NOW THEN ISTALL DJANGO_REST_FRAMEWORK TO WORK WITH APIs:=
     A. pip install djangorestframework
     B. IN THE PROJECT SETTINGS.PY IN INSTALLED_APPS ADD THIS ALSO =
        ['rest_framework',
         'rest_framework.authtoken',
        ]
     C. IN PROJECT URLS.PY ADD THIS urlpatterns = [
        path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls'))
        ]
     D. REST_FRAMEWORK = {
          # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,
          # or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.
          'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
         'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly'
          ]
        }

     E. REST_FRAMEWORK = {
            'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
                'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
                'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
                'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',  // MANUALLY ADDED
                 //BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO USE CSTOM LOGIN AUTHENTICATION NOT DJANGOS 
            ]
        }

11. NOW LETS CHECK IF SERVER IS RUNNING BUT PAGE GIVING ERROR !!!DONT WORRY ITS FNE DUDE
12. NOW LETS ADD STATIC/MEDIA FOLDER TO STORE IMAGES,MPS,VIDEOS ETC. SO THAT WE CAN ACCESS IT PUBLICALLY
    LIKE WE USE CDN IN BOOTSTRAP ..CDN JUST LOADS THE FILE STORED IN SERVER PUBLICALLY
     
     A. make a new folder inside project root -->media
     B. IN SETTINGS.PY ADD:=
        a. MEDIA_URL= '/media/'
        b. MEDIA_ROOT= os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
        c. in projects urls.py add this 
            from django.conf.urls.static import static

            from django.conf import settings

            urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)



13. IMPLEMENTING [ CATEGORY ] SECTION TO WORK:===

     A.  CREATE MODEL
     B.  REGISTER IN ADMIN
     C.  CREATE serializers.py FILE TO SERIALIZE DATA INTO JSON 
     D.  VIEWS TO ALL CATEGORY (IMPLEMEMNT VIEWS.PY)
     E.  IMPLEMENT URLS.PY TO ROUTE THE URLS
